icub-tests
==========
The `icub-tests` repository contains tests for the iCub robot. Tests are written using the Robot Testing Framework (RTF). 
See https://github.com/robotology/robot-testing for how to use RTF.

## Installing RTF

If you have not installed RTF, Please see http://robotology.github.io/robot-testing/index.html . 
Note that `icub-tests` use the YARP support in RTF, so please check that RTF is compiled with the `ENABLE_MIDDLEWARE_PLUGINS` CMake option setted to ON. You should also make sure that the yarpmanager 
plugin generated by RTF can be found by the testrunner. For more info on how to install RTF with
YARP support, please check the [YARP support documentation on RTF](https://github.com/robotology/robot-testing/blob/master/doc/yarp_configuration.md) .


## Building tests 

On Linux machines, open a terminal and type:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/robotology/icub-tests.git
    $ cd icub-tests; 
    $ mkdir build; cd build
    $ cmake ../; make
```
On windows machines use the CMake program to create Visual Studio project and build it. 

Note: in case CMake fails to detect the RTF package check that you installed RTF or that you set the RTF_DIR environment variables to point to the build directory. Also check that RTF was compiled with YARP support enables (set `ENABLE_MIDDLEWARE_PLUGINS` and verify that `ENABLE_YARP` is ON).

## Configuration

* Test cases are built as RTF plug-ins (shared libraries) and can be found in `icub-tests/build/plugins` folder. We need to add the plug-ins path to the platform library environment variable (i.e., `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` on Linux machine). 

```
    $ echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path to icub_tests/build/plugins>' >> ~/.bashrc
```

* Tests configuration (.ini files) can be found in `icub-tests/suit/contexts`. We need to configure `YARP_DATA_DIRS` environment variable so that the test cases can load the configuration files.

```
    $ echo 'export YARP_DATA_DIRS=$YARP_DATA_DIRS:<path to icub-tests/suit>' >> ~/.bashrc
```


## Writing new test cases

* Create a folder with the name of your test case in the `icub-tests/src/` folder to keep your test codes: 

```
    $ mkdir icub-tests/src/example-test
```

* Create a child test class inherited from the `YarpTestCase`:

```c++
#ifndef _CAMERATEST_H_
#define _CAMERATEST_H_

#include <YarpTestCase.h>

class ExampleTest : public YarpTestCase {
public:
    ExampleTest();
    virtual ~ExampleTest();

    virtual bool setup(yarp::os::Property& property);

    virtual void tearDown();

    virtual void run();
};

#endif //_CAMERATEST_H
```

* Implement the test case: 

```c++
#include <Plugin.h>
#include "ExampleTest.h"

using namespace std;
using namespace RTF;
using namespace yarp::os;

// prepare the plugin
PREPARE_PLUGIN(ExampleTest)

ExampleTest::ExampleTest() : YarpTestCase("ExampleTest") {
}

ExampleTest::~ExampleTest() { }

bool ExampleTest::setup(yarp::os::Property &property) {

    // initialization goes here ...
    //updating the test name
    if(property.check("name"))
        setName(property.find("name").asString());
   
    string example = property.check("example", Value("default value")).asString();

    RTF_TEST_REPORT(Asserter::format("Use '%s' for the example param!",
                                       example.c_str()));
    return true;
}

void ExampleTest::tearDown() {
    // finalization goes here ...
}

void ExampleTest::run() {

    int a = 5; int b = 3;
    RTF_TEST_REPORT("testing a < b");
    RTF_TEST_CHECK(a<b, Asserter::format("%d is not smaller than %d.", a, b));
    RTF_TEST_REPORT("testing a > b");
    RTF_TEST_CHECK(a>b, Asserter::format("%d is not smaller than %d.", a, b));
    RTF_TEST_REPORT("testing a == b");
    RTF_TEST_CHECK(a==b, Asserter::format("%d is not smaller than %d.", a, b));
    // add more 
    // ...
}
```

Notice: The `RTF_TEST_CHECK`, `RTF_TEST_REPORT` do NOT threw any exception and are used to add failure or report messages to the result collector. Instead, all the macros which include `_ASSERT_` within their names (e.g., `RTF_ASSERT_FAIL`) throw exceptions which prevent only the current test case (Not the whole test suite) of being proceed. The error/failure messages thrown by the exceptions are caught. (See [*Basic Assertion macros*](http://robotology.github.io/robot-testing/documentation/TestAssert_8h.html)). 

The report/assertion macros store the source line number where the check/report or assertion happen. To see them, you can run the test case or suit with `--detail` parameter using the `testrunner` (See [*Running test case plug-ins using testrunner*](http://robotology.github.io/robot-testing/documentation/testrunner.html)). 

* Create a cmake file to build the plug-in: 

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.8.9)

# set the project name
set(PROJECTNAME ExampleTest)
project(${PROJECTNAME})

# add the required cmake packages
find_package(RTF)
find_package(RTF COMPONENTS DLL)
find_package(YARP)

# add include directories
include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}
                    ${RTF_INCLUDE_DIRS}
                    ${YARP_INCLUDE_DIRS}
                    ${YARP_HELPERS_INCLUDE_DIR})

# add required libraries 
link_libraries(${RTF_LIBRARIES}
               ${YARP_LIBRARIES})

# add the source codes to build the plugin library
add_library(${PROJECTNAME} MODULE ExampleTest.h
                                  ExampleTest.cpp)

# set the installation options
install(TARGETS ${PROJECTNAME}
        EXPORT ${PROJECTNAME}
        COMPONENT runtime
        LIBRARY DESTINATION lib)
```

* Call your cmake file from the `icub-test/CMakeLists.txt` to build it along with the other other test plugins.
To do that, adds the following line to the `icub-test/CMakeLists.txt`

```
    # Build example test 
    add_subdirectory(src/example-test)
```

Please check the `icub-tests/example` folder for a template for developing tests for the iCub. 

## Running a single test case

As it is documented here ([*Running test case plug-ins using testrunner*](http://robotology.github.io/robot-testing/documentation/testrunner.html)) 
you can run a single test case or run it with the other tests using a test suite.  For example, to run a single test case: 

```
    testrunner --verbose --test plugins/ExampleTest.so  --param "--name MyExampleTest"
```

Notice that this test require the `yarpserver` to be running and it contains tests that are programmed to succeed and some that are programmed to fail.

or to run the iCubSim camera test whith the test configuration file:

```
    testrunner --verbose --test plugins/CameraTest.so --param "--from right_camera.ini" --environment "--robotname icubSim"
```

This runs the icubSim right-camera test with the parameters specified in the `right_camera.ini` which can be found in `icub-tests/suits/contexts/icubSim` folder. This test assumes you are running `yarpserver` and the iCub simulator (i.e. `iCub_SIM`).

Notice that the environment parameter `--robotname icubSim` is used to locate the correct context (for this examples is `icubSim`) and also to update the variables loaded from the `right_camera.ini` file. 


## Running multiple tests using a test suite

You can update one of the existing suite XML files to add your test case plug-in and its parameters or create a new test suite which keeps all the relevant test cases. 
For example the `basic-icubSim.xml` test suite keeps the basic tests for cameras and motors: 

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<suit name="Basic Tests Suite">
    <description>Testing robot's basic features</description>
    <environment>--robotname icubSim</environment>
    <fixture param="--fixture icubsim-fixture.xml"> yarpmanager </fixture>

    <!-- Camera -->
    <test type="dll" param="--from right_camera.ini"> CameraTest </test>
    <test type="dll" param="--from left_camera.ini"> CameraTest </test> 
    
    <!-- Motors -->
    <test type="dll" param="--from test_right_arm.ini"> MotorTest </test>
    <test type="dll" param="--from test_left_arm.ini"> MotorTest </test>
</suit>

```

Then you can run all the test cases from the test suite: 

```
    testrunner --verbose --suit icub-tests/suits/basics-icubSim.xml
```

The `testrunner`, first, launches the iCub simulator and then runs all the tests one after each other. After running all the test cases, the `tesrunner` stop the simulator. If the 
iCub simulator crashes during the test run, the `testrunner` re-launchs it and continues running the remaining tests. 

How `testrunner` knows that it should launch the iCub simulator before running the tests? Well, this is indicated by `<fixture param="--fixture icubsim-fixture.xml"> yarpmanager </fixture>`. 
The `testrunner` uses the `yarpmanager` fixture plug-in to launch the modules which are listed in the `icubsim-fixture.xml`.  Notice that all the fixture files should be located in the `icub-tests/suits/fixtures` folder.
