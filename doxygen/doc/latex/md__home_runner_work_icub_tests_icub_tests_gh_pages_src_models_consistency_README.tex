Set of tests meant to ensure consistency in kinematics model used in i\+Cub.

\doxysection*{ikin-\/idyn-\/consistency }

This test will check that the end effector transforms (for the two hands and the two feet) provided by the i\+Kin chains and the i\+Dyn i\+Cub\+Whole\+Body object are consistent. While i\+Dyn is being discontinued, this check is important because URDF models for some model of i\+Cub (for example i\+Cub v1) are generated from i\+Dyn models.
